Heart all around my feet
Don't you ever sweep the streets
If they still can keep a beat
Hands holding other hands
I'm a girl and you're a man
Do you know what's moving me?

One night a meteor
Came to my door
And he asked me to dance
One night
A shooting star
He traveled far just to ask me to dance

Arms give away your need
Tie them up and around me
And play me as you please
Dance nothing left to spare
Fill it up with all your air
You're the one I want to see

One night a meteor
Came to my door
And he asked me to dance
One night
A shooting star
He traveled far just to ask me to dance

Oh la lala x4

One night a meteor
Came to my door
And he asked me to dance
One night
A shooting star
He traveled far just to ask me to dance
