A meteor
You move away the heats burning down
You missed us and let dawn surround
You might as well be

Moving dying I'm haunted
Say it burns like dust alone
You're made of doubt lay in your grave
The more I leave it burns

You let it die you see the light
You want it all on this side
You reach out you're letting go of all of us it's time
We let it die we see the light
You let it burn out
You wanted out and now you are embraced

A meteor
You move away the heat's burning down
You're all a lie shame you won't be found
You might as well be

Moving dying I'm haunted
Say it burns like dust alone
You're made of doubt as if you've made
All of your pieces that turned to grey

Where do we fall down to lay
Who lay me down in doubt
You made it down you say it burns you up
Move around and notice sounds
